COVID-19 Data Analysis & Loan Prediction Project
Overview:
Analyzed COVID-19 data for trends by continent and key metrics, then built a logistic regression model to predict loan approvals on a loan dataset.

Steps:

COVID-19 Analysis: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualizations (histograms, scatter, pair, and bar plots).
Loan Prediction: Preprocessed data, trained a logistic regression model, and evaluated accuracy and confusion matrix.
Key Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn.

Results:
COVID insights on cases and GDP; loan model achieved solid accuracy for predictions.
